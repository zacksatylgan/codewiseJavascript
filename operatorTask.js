 **Task: Calculate the Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle**
    
    Write a JavaScript program that:
    
    1. Creates two variables, `length` and `width`, for a rectangle.
    2. Calculates the **area** (length × width).
    3. Calculates the **perimeter** (2 × (length + width)).
    4. Prints both results.
*/

let length = 8; 
let width = 4;

let area = length * width;

console.log('Area of rectangle: ', area);

let perimeter = 2 * (length + width);

console.log("Perimeter of rectangle: = ", perimeter );
